Running a benchmark
--------------------

**Introduction to benchmarking**

Automatminer can be used for benchmarking ML performance on materials
problems in a standardized fashion. A common example use case is comparing one
published method to another; another use is getting a rough idea how an
Automatminer model will generalize to making "real" predictions. To mitigate
unfair model advantages from biased splits or hyperparameter tuning,
Automatminer uses nested cross validation with identical
outer splits for benchmarking:

.. image:: _static/cv_nested.png
   :alt: server
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

Nested CV is analagous to using multiple hold-out test sets.

*Note: Nested CV is a computationally expensive benchmarking procedure!*

**Usage**

:code:`MatPipe` has a :code:`benchmark` method which can be used for
automatically benchmarking a pipeline on a dataset. Once you have your
data loaded in a dataframe, the procedure is:

1. Define a k-fold cross validation scheme (to use as outer test folds).

2. Use the :code:`benchmark` method of :code:`MatPipe` to get predictions for
each outer fold

3. Use your scoring function of choice to evaluate each fold.

.. code-block:: python

    from sklearn.model_evaluation import KFold

    # We recommend KFold for regression problems and StratifiedKFold
    # for classification
    kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True)

    from automatminer.pipeline import MatPipe

    pipe = MatPipe.from_preset("express")
    predicted_folds = pipe.benchmark(my_df, "my_property", kf)

:code:`benchmark` returns a list of the predicted test folds (i.e., your
entire dataset as if it were test folds). These test folds can then be used
to get estimates of error, compare to other pipelines, etc.


**Matbench**

Interested in benchmarking your new algorithm in similar fashion? Or want to try
an Automatminer configuration on benchmarking data?

`Matminer <https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer>`_
provides access to the MatBench benchmark suite, a curated set of 13 diverse
materials ML problems which work in Automatminer benchmarks. Learn more here:
:doc:`MatBench </datasets>`


Time Savers and Practical Tools
-------------------------------

**Using user-defined features**

Often, there will be important features associated with your data which
automatminer has not implemented. To use your own features for learning,
simply:

1. include them in **both** your training and prediction dataframes

2. do not name the columns the same as AutoFeaturizer inputs (by default,
"structure", "composition", "bandstructure", and "dos").

Thats it! Your features have been included in the pipeline, although depending
on the pipeline configuration (such as feature reduction), the features may
be dropped if needed. If you want to ensure your features are used for learning,
see the section on customizing pipelines.


**Ignoring columns**

During prediction, MatPipe automatically handles dropping problematic columns
and materials inputs (e.g., structures) for inputs to ML. If you want to keep
columns in your predictions and prevent them from being used for learning,
specify the :code:`ignore` argument to :code:`predict`.

Let's say this is the dataframe you'd like to predict on:

:code:`test_df`

.. list-table::
   :align: left
   :header-rows: 1

   * - :code:`structure`
     - :code:`material-id`
   * - :code:`<structure object>`
     - :code:`m-12345`
   * - :code:`<structure object>`
     - :code:`m-5983`
   * - :code:`<structure object>`
     - :code:`m-029393`
   * - ...
     - ...

In this example, we want to keep the :code:`material-id` column for identifying
our predicted samples and we don't want to use it as a learning feature. This
is the intended use case for :code:`ignore`.

Assuming you've already fit a :code:`MatPipe` on the target :code:`my_property`,
specify you'd like to ignore the materials column:

.. code-block:: python

    predicted_df = pipe.predict(test_df, ignore=["material-id"])

Your output will look like this:

:code:`predicted_df`

.. list-table::
   :align: left
   :header-rows: 1

   * - :code:`structure`
     - :code:`material-id`
     - ...
     - :code:`my_property predicted`
   * - :code:`<structure object>`
     - :code:`m-12345`
     - ...
     - 0.449
   * - :code:`<structure object>`
     - :code:`m-5983`
     - ...
     - -0.573
   * - :code:`<structure object>`
     - :code:`m-029393`
     - ...
     - -0.005
   * - ...
     - ...
     - ...
     - ...

The ignore argument also works when benchmarking with :code:`MatPipe.benchmark`.

**Warning**

Ignoring columns in MatPipe supercedes all inner operations. If inner operations
require a feature ignored in the MatPipe predict, the pipeline will fail.


Customizing pipelines
---------------------

**Overview**

So far, we have only worked with the top level interface object, MatPipe,
created through preset configurations. If you find the MatPipe presets are too
restrictive, you can specify your own custom pipelines.

Here is a (very incomplete) list of things you can do with custom pipelines:

* choose your own matminer featurizer sets to use
* customize AutoML parameters
* add, remove, or modify feature reduction techniques
* change the imputation behavior and NaN handling
* change feature encoding
* modify featurizer prechecking and other automatic matminer operations
* customize multiprocessing parallelization
* and much more!

MatPipe is a container object for four sklearn BaseEstimator-like
classes (called DFTransformers) doing all the real work:

* :code:`AutoFeaturizer`: (:code:`MatPipe.autofeaturizer`) Creates and assigns features for each sample
* :code:`DataCleaner`: (:code:`MatPipe.cleaner`) Prepares samples for input to ML algorithms
* :code:`FeatureReducer`: (:code:`MatPipe.reducer`) Reduce the number of features with statistical learning.
* :code:`DFMLAdaptor`: (:code:`MatPipe.learner`) A machine learning adaptor to make predictions using an ML backend (e.g., TPOT). As of this writing, there is :code:`TPOTAdaptor` and :code:`SinglePipelineAdaptor`


The interface to MatPipe is the same regardless of the DFTransformers they
are made of.
**Define custom pipelines by initializing these classes individually, then
passing them into MatPipe's __init__**.

**Modifying a preset pipeline**

The easiest way to start making custom pipelines is by modifying a preset
config, then passing it into MatPipe. In this example, let's set the TPOT
learning time to 1 hour and set the number of multiprocessing jobs to 4.

.. code-block:: python

    from automatminer import get_preset_config, TPOTAdaptor, MatPipe

    # Get the config
    config = get_preset_config("express")

    # Define a custom TPOTAdaptor to replace the express one
    config["learner"] = TPOTAdaptor(max_time_mins=60, n_jobs=4)

    # Make a matpipe
    pipe = MatPipe(**config)

Your custom pipeline is now ready to fit, predict, and benchmark.

**A fully custom pipeline**

Here we'll show how to make a fully custom pipeline.

.. code-block:: python

    from xgboost import XGBRegressor, XGBClassifier

    from automatminer import AutoFeaturizer, FeatureReducer, DataCleaner, \
        SinglePipelineAdaptor

    autofeaturizer = AutoFeaturizer(from_preset="production",
                                    cache_src="./features.json",
                                    exclude=["EwaldEnergy"])
    cleaner = DataCleaner(max_na_frac=0.05)
    reducer = FeatureReducer(reducers=("corr",))
    learner = SinglePipelineAdaptor(classifier=XGBClassifier(n_estimators=500),
                                    regressor=XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500))

    # Make a matpipe
    pipe = MatPipe(
        autofeaturizer=autofeaturizer,
        cleaner=cleaner,
        reducer=reducer,
        learner=learner
    )


We only specify a few options in this example, but each class is quite flexible.


Using DFTransformers individually
---------------------------------

DFTransformers can also be used outside of a MatPipe, if you only need part of a
pipeline. Each implements a 'fit'/'transform' syntax, where the input and
output are dataframes (the same as MatPipe).

For example, if you are looking to generate features without any cleaning,
feature reduction, or machine learning, do:

.. code-block:: python

    from automatminer import AutoFeaturizer

    autofeaturizer = AutoFeaturizer(from_preset="express")

    # Fit the DFTransformer
    autofeaturizer.fit(my_input_df, target="my_target_property")

    # Generate the features using the DFTransformer
    df = autofeaturizer.transform(my_input_df, target="my_target_property")

    # Or equivalently,
    # df = autofeaturizer.fit_transform(my_input_df, target="my_target_property)
